#are they asking for std dev or variance....does the difference matter?

#              plants$weight[plants$group == 'trt1'], 
#              plants$weight[plants$group == 'trt2'])
#bartlett.test(select(filter(PlantGrowth, group == 'ctrl'), weight),
#              select(filter(PlantGrowth, group == 'trt1'), weight),
#              select(filter(PlantGrowth, group == 'trt2'), weight))

bartlett.test(weight ~ group, PlantGrowth)    #compare the variances of the weights grouped_by group
#Bartlett's K-squared = 2.8786, df = 2, p-value = 0.2371 = 23% > 5%
#retain null, they do NOT differ significantly



#3
#One-way ANOVA Test (comparing more than two means)
#h0 : there is no significant difference in weight by group
#hA : mu(weight) differ significantly by applied treatment
summary(aov(weight ~ group, PlantGrowth))  #anova test of weight by treatment group 
#            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)

#p-value = .0159 = 1.6% < 5%
#reject h0, because the means differ significantly 

#??? I do not know how to relate this to the Bartlett test
#the anova test assumes no sig diff in std devs, since the Bartlett test showed this to be true,
#the ANOVA test result is valid
